Each blog have own registration and own pool of quotes.
Fetching quotes by user done with SQLFilter.
I've tried to implement own token and user management for auth system but not finished it.
It is working but need some improvements.
In general current version is far from final and require refactoring
I underestimate the task and was influenced with pressure to deliver some results.
I know I was warned about this but it is as it is.
